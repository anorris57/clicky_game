# clicky_game
For this assignment, you'll create a memory game with React. This assignment will require you to break up your application's UI into components, manage component state, and respond to user events.

Challenge: To build first app using react as the front end.

Requirements: Set up react components so that user can play "Click Memory Game". This entails the setting up images for user to click on, setting up function(s) to track and increment score based on # of clicks, tracking # of clicks, randomizing images on click.

I attacked  this in a stepwise mannder by setting up simple individual functions to handle events so that I could see what worked and easily identify what didn't work. 

A few of the lessons I learned:
1) Set up simple app using react.
2) How to get static images to display in react. 
    I built an image.json file with ids to use in my state object.
    Also learned it is easier to start with images of the same size.
3) The meaning of having the required identifier on the first element of what is being mapped.
4) Using bootstrap/css correctly to set up presentable UI.

 Several of the many growth requirements:
1) How to make more compenents by better understanding difference between functional and class components.
2) This follows from the first: the passing of props.
3) Better understanding of arrow functions (usage/properties);
